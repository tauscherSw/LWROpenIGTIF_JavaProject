/**
 * Interface for the LWR States defining the Functions void
 * CalcControlParam(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine), void
 * SetACKString(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine) and void
 * SetACKString(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine).So far realized States are:
 * Idle, GravComp, Registration, SendData, WaitforData, Virtual Fixtures,
 * PathImp, MovetoPose and Error. For Further Information see the Documentation
 * of the particular states.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * How To add a new State:
 * 	- Add a new State to the LWRStatus enum in the LWRStatemachine class
 * 	- Generate a new class derived from this interface (LWRState) and write the desired functions CalcControlParam(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine), SetACKPacket(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine) and InterpretCMDPacket(LWRStatemachine lwrStatemachine)
 * 	- Add this State to the if-else block in the LWRStatemachine function CheckTransistionRequest() and define the transition condition
 * 	- Send the Command plus parameters and check if it works
 * </pre>
